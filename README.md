## Timeline

[5/21/22 Day 1](day_1): Writing basic html5 to create websites with only simple text

[5/21/22 Day 2](day_2): How to use elements such as img and anachors to lead users to sub pages. I started the beginning of a personal website to include in my portfolio. I started basics into using tables using table element in html. Padding will later be explored through use of CSS.
